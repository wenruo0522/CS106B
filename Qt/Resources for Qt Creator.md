### Resources for Qt Creator

***

Students in the CS106B/courses use **Qt Creator** to write C++ programs. Qt Creator is an *integrated development environment* (IDE) with tools to edit, build, run, and debug programs.

- **Installing Qt Creator**

  We have prepared installation guides for each operating system, choose the one for your computer.

  - Install [Qt Creator on Mac OS X](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/resources/qt/install-mac)
  - Install [Qt Creator on Windows](./Install Qt Creator on Windows.md)
  - Install [Qt Creator on Linux](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/resources/qt/install-linux)

  This will guide you through downloading and installing Qt and other necessary tools, as well as configuring the CS106-specific package. Please follow the instructions carefully and do not skip steps. In the final step, you will do a build and run cycle on a sample project. If you have successfully done this, your installation is good to go!

- **If you have a previous version Qt installed**

  The version of Qt as of Fall Quarter 2022 is >= **Qt 6.3** (Breaking News as of 9/28: Qt just published update **Qt 6.4**, either version 6.4 or 6.3 will work for CS106B).

  If you have previously installed an older version of Qt, first **uninstall that version** and then continue with a fresh install of the latest using the instructions linked above.

  - To uninstall Qt, run `MaintenanceTool` from your `Qt` folder. Check the box "Uninstall only" on the first pane and follow the instructions.
